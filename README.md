## Rough Instructions

These are pulled from [Slack's API](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tunneling-with-ngrok) site.

My code assumes you're using a file (ignored) called `app-env` to store config that you're planning to obscure.

To run the app type the following from your slackapp directory using the Terminal:

`sudo node index.js`

If everything goes well, the following should be printed on your console:

`Server listening on:`

Now try visiting your ngrok address once more and you should be pleasantly surprised with a Ngrok is working! message. Well done!
